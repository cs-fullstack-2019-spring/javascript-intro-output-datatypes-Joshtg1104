Create an HTML file called ```index.html`` 

Add JavaScript inline (using <script> tags) that does the following:

* Defines a string variable called ```name``` and assign it your name

* Defines a numeric variable called ```age``` that contains your age

* Write the code to log ```My name is YOURNAME and I am YOURAGE``` in the developer console
